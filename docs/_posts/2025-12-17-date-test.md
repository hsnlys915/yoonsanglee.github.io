As part of my graduate training in political science and international relations, I have learned to use basic programming and document-preparation tools such as **R** and **LaTeX** for statistical social science research.

Alongside my thesis work, I began a side project to develop **LaTeX thesis templates** in both **Korean** and **English**. These templates are designed for students in the **Department of Political Science and International Relations at Seoul National University**.

Here, I present a **working version of a master’s thesis template** for the department.

Please refer to the
<strong>
<a href="https://github.com/hsnlys915/snu_thesis_template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
GitHub repository
</a>
</strong>
to access the template.

This is a **public GitHub repository** that contains the most up-to-date version of the template. You can clone the repository to your local machine to begin writing your own thesis manuscript.

The template depends on the **LuaLaTeX** engine in order to support Korean typesetting, using the `luatexko` package.

While this version is intended for a **master’s thesis**, the standard template for a **doctoral dissertation** shares most of the same document structure. The primary differences involve the required number of committee members and certain titles and headings on the title pages, which can be modified accordingly.
